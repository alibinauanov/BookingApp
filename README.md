# BookingApp

Booking Application where user can check any hotel rooms with prices.<br/>
<br/>
I used ReactJS for Front-End part, Node.js + MongoDB for Back-end part.

## Run application
1)Open 2 terminals. The first one is for api folder, the second is for client<br/>
2)```yarn start``` for React<br/>
3)```yarn start``` for Node.js<br/>
